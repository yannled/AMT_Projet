 * This is a pure test project. The System-Under-Test (SUT) is another project,
 * i.e. a Java EE application named MVCDemo. All the code is located in the 
 * test packages.
 * 
 * The tests can be run via maven or via Netbeans. They consist of JUnit classes,
 * which use the Selenium WebDriver API to control a web browser and perform
 * User Acceptance Tests (UATs).
